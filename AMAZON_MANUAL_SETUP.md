   - Go to your admin dashboard
   - Navigate to `/products/manual-amazon`
   - Or visit: `http://localhost:3002/products/manual-amazon`

2. **Convert URLs**:
   - Select the appropriate tracking ID for your product category
   - Paste Amazon URLs (one per line)
   - Click "Convert to Affiliate Links"
   - Copy or export the generated affiliate links

### Using the API Directly

```bash
# Convert multiple URLs

```

### Examples by Category

**Wearable Tech** (`weartech00-20`):
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW?tag=weartech00-20
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ6ZQ1B?tag=weartech00-20
```

**General Merchandise** (`jmpkch23-20`):
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSH9J6YF?tag=jmpkch23-20
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW?tag=jmpkch23-20
```

**Hot Honey Products** (`hothoneyfever00-20`):
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW?tag=hothoneyfever00-20
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ6ZQ1B?tag=hothoneyfever00-20
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Category Matching
