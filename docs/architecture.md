## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The platform will be a serverless, full-stack application built on a modern Jamstack architecture. The frontend will be a responsive Next.js application hosted on Vercel, providing optimal performance and SEO. The backend will be powered by Supabase, which will handle the PostgreSQL database, user authentication, and file storage. The system will be organized in a monorepo to maximize code sharing and simplify dependency management. This architecture directly supports the PRD goals of scalability, rapid deployment, and a seamless admin experience.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

* **Platform:** The Vercel + Supabase stack is recommended.
* **Rationale:** Vercel provides a world-class, serverless hosting platform with first-party support for Next.js, ensuring seamless deployment and scaling. Supabase offers a complete backend-as-a-service (BaaS) with a Postgres database, authentication, and storage, which perfectly matches the project's needs and reduces backend boilerplate.
* **Key Services:**
    * **Vercel:** Hosting, Serverless Functions, CI/CD.
    * **Supabase:** PostgreSQL Database, Auth, Storage.

### Repository Structure

* **Structure:** Monorepo.
* **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo.
* **Rationale:** A monorepo is ideal for this project as it will contain multiple packages: the admin dashboard, the public site template, shared UI components, and shared types/logic. Turborepo will manage the build process efficiently.

    You are absolutely right. My sincere apologies. I misunderstood your request and broke the documents into two separate blocks when you asked for a single file. My job is to make this process seamless for you, and I failed to do that.

Let me correct this immediately.

I will combine both the **Product Requirements Document** and the **Fullstack Architecture Document** into one single, continuous markdown block below. You can use a "copy" button on the top right of the block to grab the entire content at once and save it as a single `.md` file on your computer.

### Architectural Patterns

  * **Jamstack Architecture:** The public-facing sites will be built as fast, static, or server-rendered sites hydrated with dynamic data, providing excellent performance and security.
  * **Component-Based UI:** The frontend will be built with reusable React components, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
  * **Repository Pattern:** Backend data access will be abstracted using a repository pattern to decouple business logic from the database implementation (Prisma ORM).
  * **Serverless Functions:** All backend logic will be encapsulated in serverless functions (via Next.js API routes), which are scalable and cost-effective.

## Data Models

Core data models will be defined using TypeScript interfaces in a shared package to ensure type safety across the frontend and backend.

### Site

  * **Purpose:** Represents a single niche affiliate website.
  * **TypeScript Interface:**
    ```typescript
    interface Site {
      id: string; // UUID
      name: string;
      url: string;
      owner_id: string; // Foreign key to users.id
      created_at: Date;
    }
    ```

### Post

  * **Purpose:** Represents a single blog post.
  * **TypeScript Interface:**
    ```typescript
    interface Post {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      slug: string;
      content: JSON; // Or string for Markdown
      status: 'draft' | 'pending_approval' | 'published';
      site_id: string; // Foreign key to sites.id
      featured_image_url?: string;
      published_at?: Date;
    }
    ```

## API Spec

We will use tRPC for end-to-end type-safe API communication. The API routers will be defined in the backend and the types will be automatically inferred on the frontend.

### tRPC Router Example (`postRouter`)

```typescript
import { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure } from "../trpc";
import { z } from "zod";

export const postRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  getPublishedPosts: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ siteId: z.string() }))
    .query(({ ctx, input }) => {
      // ctx.prisma is the database client
      return ctx.prisma.post.findMany({
        where: {
          site_id: input.siteId,
          status: 'published',
        },
      });
    }),
  // ... other procedures for creating, updating posts
});
```

## Unified Project Structure

The project will use a Turborepo-managed monorepo structure.

```plaintext
affiliate-platform/
├── apps/
│   ├── admin/                # Next.js app for the admin dashboard
│   └── web/                  # Next.js app for the public site template
├── packages/
│   ├── db/                   # Prisma schema, client, and migrations
│   ├── shared-types/         # Shared TypeScript interfaces (Site, Post, etc.)
│   ├── ui/                   # Shared React components (Buttons, Cards, etc.)
│   └── eslint-config-custom/ # Shared ESLint configuration
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── turborepo.json
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup

A script will be provided to set up local environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env`. The developer will need Docker for running a local Postgres instance mirroring Supabase.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start all applications in development mode
npm run dev

# Run all tests
npm run test
```

## Deployment Architecture

  * **Frontend & Backend Deployment:** Both the `admin` and `web` Next.js applications will be deployed to Vercel.
  * **CI/CD Pipeline:** A GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered on pushes to the `main` branch. It will use Turborepo's remote caching to only build and deploy packages that have changed.
  * **Database:** Database migrations will be managed by Prisma and applied to the Supabase database as part of the CI/CD pipeline or manually for production.

## Security

  * **Authentication:** Handled by Supabase Auth. The admin dashboard will be protected, requiring a login.
  * **Authorization:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be enforced in Supabase to ensure data from one site cannot be accessed by another user or site.
  * **Secrets Management:** All API keys and secrets will be stored as environment variables in Vercel and Supabase, never committed to the repository.

## Testing Strategy

  * **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library will be used for testing individual components and functions in the `ui` and `shared-types` packages.
  * **Integration Tests:** Backend API routes and database interactions will be tested by connecting to a test database.
  * **E2E Tests:** Playwright will be used to test critical user flows, such as logging in, generating a post, and approving it.
