# Product Requirements Document (prd.md)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* To drastically reduce the manual effort required for affiliate marketing by automating content creation and management.
* To create a scalable, reusable platform that can support a portfolio of multiple niche websites from a single admin interface.
* To build a robust analytics system for tracking clicks, conversions, and revenue across all sites.
* To leverage modern AI and a headless architecture to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized content that drives affiliate sales.

### Background Context

This project addresses the primary bottleneck for affiliate marketers: the time-consuming nature of content creation and portfolio management. By creating a centralized platform that automates blog and product posts using AI, the system allows a single operator to scale their efforts significantly. This PRD outlines the requirements for an MVP focused on proving the viability of this automated content pipeline, with a clear path for future expansion.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The platform will consist of two distinct user experiences: a clean, content-focused, and fast-loading public website template, and a powerful, data-rich admin dashboard. The admin dashboard's UX will prioritize efficiency and clarity, enabling the operator to manage the entire portfolio with ease.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Admin:** A task-oriented interface with clear navigation between site management, content generation, product management, and analytics.
* **Public Site:** A traditional blog layout that is easy to navigate, highly readable, and optimized for mobile devices.

### Core Screens and Views

* Admin Login Screen
* Admin Dashboard (with aggregate analytics)
* Site Management View (list of niche sites, individual site analytics)
* Content Generation & Approval Queue
* Product Management & Custom Fields View
* Public Blog Homepage / Article List
* Public Blog Post Detail Page

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA will be the target standard for the public-facing websites to ensure they are accessible to all users.

### Branding

The public-facing site template should be easily customizable with a logo, color scheme, and font selection on a per-site basis. The admin dashboard will have a consistent, clean, and functional brand identity.

### Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (Desktop & Mobile) for both the public sites and the admin dashboard.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

Monorepo

### Service Architecture

A headless architecture with a Next.js frontend, a backend powered by Supabase (database, auth, edge functions), and Payload for CMS capabilities.

### Testing requirements

The system will require unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API connections, and E2E tests for critical user flows like content generation and publishing.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

* The reconciliation of affiliate conversions will be handled by a scheduled job (e.g., Supabase cron job) that pulls reports from the affiliate platforms.

## Epics

1.  **Epic 1: Foundation & Admin Setup**: Establish the core infrastructure, including the monorepo, Supabase project, Vercel integration, and a secure admin dashboard with authentication.
2.  **Epic 2: AI Content Pipeline & CMS Integration**: Integrate with AI services (text and image) and Payload CMS to create a robust, automated content generation and management workflow.
3.  **Epic 3: Affiliate Integration & Frontend Display**: Connect to the Amazon Associates API, create the reusable frontend website template, and display the generated content and products to the public.
4.  **Epic 4: Analytics, Marketing & Multi-Site Management**: Build the analytics dashboard, implement the newsletter feature, and enable the management of multiple distinct niche sites.
