# Changelog

## [Latest] - 2025-01-23

### Fixed
- **Import/Export Issues**: Resolved `getSiteConfig` import error by rebuilding the `@affiliate/db` package
- **UI Component Client Issues**: Added `"use client"` directives to React components using hooks (Dropdown, Form, Toast)
- **Admin App Startup**: Fixed admin dashboard startup issues by resolving UI component dependencies
- **Environment Variables**: Copied `.env.local` to both web and admin apps for proper database configuration

### Current Status
- ✅ **Web App**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000
  - Homepage loads with fallback site configuration
  - Featured posts and products display correctly
  - Responsive design working properly
  - Database connection errors are handled gracefully with fallback data

- ✅ **Admin App**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3001
  - Admin dashboard loads with comprehensive UI components
  - All pages (analytics, products, email marketing, etc.) accessible
  - UI components properly marked as client components

### Known Issues
- **Database Connection**: Supabase database is not accessible with current credentials
  - Web app falls back to default site configuration
  - Admin app may have limited functionality without database
  - This is expected with placeholder environment variables

### Next Steps
